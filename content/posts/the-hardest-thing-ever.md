The hardest thing ever is to never forget your why.

the harder thing is to not get distracted.

Why are you doing what you doing? And for what , for whom.

This is hard. Other noises of your environment will make you move away from that.

Because they don't care for your why.

There is nothing that they will gain from it.

Cheers :smiley:
