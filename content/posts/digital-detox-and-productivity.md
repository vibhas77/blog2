Think about this, if every speaker around you starts playing music but all of them are playing different songs then all of them would be noise, and none of them would be useful. As a sane person, you would close down rest of the speaker and only play the speaker that is important among them to you at the current moment. And you would want the speaker to do that well and that music to be good too.

Such is the kind of scenario with Smartphone, computers and the internet in general. Being able to do simultaneously many things at the same time makes them useless/obtrusive. But if they perform only one single activity ( According to your perception ) at a given time, they become essential to us. Such as reading articles on the internet, while playing background music might be considered okay, but now add watching youtube while checking the emails to the mix is bound to be a recipe for disaster of productivity.

What we want is the ability to run multiple activities in the background while doing only one, I emphasise that only **one thing** in the foreground. And that is my lesson from my detox. This fact is the reason why I do not like notifications at all. No one needs that annoying notification whether good or bad.

I noticed that my stress level dropped down significantly when I switched off both my phone and my computer. Some of the stress that I was not even aware of before the detox. Maybe this could be because I just started paying attention to some of the activities that were in the background of my mind and bring them to the foreground, complete them and then remove them from the backdrop of my mind itself either temporarily or permanently.

Switching between activities in a very short span is not at all necessary. I find that for me, I tend to be in any single activity for a continuous stretching for **at least 4-6 hours** before I begin to move to another activity. But when I am on my digital detox but only 15-20 minutes at max when I am using my smartphone or my computer merely **switching off electronics does that to me**. This
