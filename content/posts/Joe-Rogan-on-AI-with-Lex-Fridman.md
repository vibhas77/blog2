I has been a while since I have got myself engaged into a podcast this heavy and deep. At the end of it, I was not able to believe myself that I just saw a 3 hour video with my whole mind engaged into it throughout the thing.

The discussion here has been really awesome and mind opening.

For we as a society, have an entirely new tech going to come which is AI.

I know Joe Rogan is a bit crazy. Watch it for Lex Fridman. Totally awesome guy. :wink:
