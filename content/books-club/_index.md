Book Of The Week Club - Vigo's Blog

This is the book club.

I am an avid book reader and I hope that my reviews and dedication to read books helps you in choosing your next books.

Every Monday I select a new book to read and complete as much of it as possible.

I also hope that as the views on my blog I can get better discussions and participants for each review.

Please subscribe to our book club.
